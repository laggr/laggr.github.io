			<h3>HURRICANE KATRINA: TENTH ANNIVERSARY</h3>
			<img src="images/klogo.gif">
			<p>Problem: Design a logo for a community steeped in the disaster without resorting to cliche.</p>
			<p>Process: I transfered the spray-painted X &#151; iconography that was hauntingly familiar to storm survivors in New Orleanians &#151; to typical New Orleans siding; hand drew the date of the storm with the years ’05 and ’15 on either side. The zero, which indicated the number of deaths in a home in the original tagging by military units inspecting homes after the storm, was used to indicate that New Orleans was still standing.</p>
			<p>Programs: Photoshop</p>

			<h3>LOUISIANA PURCHASED</h3>
			<img src="images/labarcode.gif">
			<p>Problem: Create a logo that has impact in print, online and on television.</p>
			<p>Process: With the idea that Louisiana was up for purchase to the highest bidder, I designed a logo where the barcode was the shape of the state. I masked an existing barcode with an image of the state. I added the words where the numbers are in barcodes. I created a red to black gradient to show a scanning laser and animated it going down the barcode.</p>

			<h3>POPLINGS FOR CASSIDY LABS</h3>
			<img src="images/popling.jpg">
			<p>Problem: Can packaging and information increase the perceived value of a toy from a parent’s point of view?</p>
			<p>Process: Over six weeks in the spring of 2017, I studied Poplings for Cassidy Labs. Observed 18 children (4 via video, 14 in person) and 8 purchasers in natural environment with all four Poplings styles. My findings led to designing a playful logo; making  the local company prominent; giving  Poplings a backstory; creating custom packages including this blister package.</p>
